        <h2>IDG1293 Portfolio Exam 2024</h2>

        <p>The portfolio showcases the three projects I've worked on for the course IDG1293 - Avansert CSS.</p>
        <h3>The portfolio design</h3>
        <p>I decided on a color palette using the <a target="_blank"
                href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel">Adobe Color
                Palette Generator</a>. The greens and pink colors are "split complimentry colors". I created the
            front page slider gallery from scratch ising html, css and JavaScript. I got some help and inspirations from
            this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ntmw8-8g_fg">YouTube Video</a>. I had the idea
            of
            linking my projects to images in this type of slider from the begginning where clicking the image would lead
            the
            user to the project website, but I felt like it wouldn't necessarily be 100% intuitive to click an image in
            a
            gallery, which is why I decided to instruct with a message and pointer. This also lead me to decide on a
            "handwritten styled" font, which I later also implemented as an indicator of current page in the nav-bar to
            provide some originality and style-consistency.</p>

        <h3>Oblig 1</h3>
        <h4>Practising BEM and using design systems</h4>
        <div class="oblig1">
            <div>
                <p>Trying to copy the design and functions of the finn.no login page mainly taught me a few lessons on
                    cooperating on github. Me and my co-worker had quite a few issues with solving problems related to
                    merges. This taught me to think twice and not make hasty conflict solving decisions when using
                    github.</p>
                <p>In terms of working with Finn's design system and using SCSS I found it very useful to store
                    variables for the different colors in a seperate css file. By doing this it was a lot easier to
                    categorize what the different colors were used for when pickig and reusing colors. It was also
                    useful when working on the same website as we'd be using many of the same colors.</p>
                <P>Looking back at the assignment I realize that I was probably "overdoing" it a little in terms of BEM
                    by dividing the page into two divs and each of them having absolutely every element "attached" to it
                    with BEM class names. As I've worked more on BEM I have come to understand the use of it a little
                    more and find it very useful. The feature I enjoy the most is nesting. This makes the code so much
                    easier to write and to work with. And it somehow provides more "common sense" to CSS.</P>

        <h3>Oblig 2</h3>
        <h4> SVGs, SVGs animations, CSS drawing, and CSS animations</h4>
        <p>I worked with Nora Storrø for the second obligatory assignment and implemented the poster design provided
            using SVGs, imported fonts, and some absolute positioning. My main contributions to the project was
            extracting SVGs and implementing the poster design. Me and my co-worker decided to do some part of the
            poster each. We found that this was both to our advantage and disadvantage. The advantage was that we'd work
            through implementing the design fairly quick, but the disadvantages were that we din't get to know the
            other's code, and it was sometimes hard to get the different parts of the poster to fit. We also found that
            the page looked and responded differently onj my laptop compared to hers, which meant we both designed and
            implemented according to our own versions.
        </p>
        <p>Our page ended up being fairly responsive due to
            using vw for most of the elements. We mainly used keyframe animations and one SVG-animation. We didn't have
            time to implement any CSS drawing, so this is one of the things I wanted to include in the new version. We
            also had some issues with the background being cut off on each side, and never managed to fix that. Another
            issue is the last two letters of the car-exhaust word-cloud being missing, probably die to the car animation
            overlapping it. This is a new issue having to be resolved. I think
            it also would have been cool to add some more advanced animations that illustrated the story
            of the poster more effectively.</p>

            <div>
                <p class="turbinado-font">Oblig 2 (old version) <span class="arrow-down">&#x2926;</span></p>

            </div>

        </div>
        <p>I initially wanted to change the whole design of the website by present the poster as an actual poster placed
            in the middle of the page, with animated elements, and still being responsive, but after spending several
            hours trying to
            start almost from scracth I gave up. Instead I decided to fix the original version. I am generally quite
            happy with the result and think it looks a lot similar to the original poster, but for some reason the
            word-cloud (behind the car) decided to drop an "i" whatever I did. I tried to draw my own path in
            illustrator as well as using the original svg, but it just didn't want to work out. </p>

            <p>Fixes:</p>

            <p>1. Post background not being cut off anymore</p>
            <p>2. Elements's size and position adjusted to resemble poster better</p>
            <p>3. Previous word-cloud exchanged for new</p>
            <p>4. Ensuring responsiveness</p>

        <h3>Oblig 3</h3>
        <h4> Storytelling, scrollytelling, intersection observer, abimations, web interactions, accessibility and fluid
        </h4>
        <div class="main-page-about__oblig3">
            <div>
                <p>On obligatory assignment 3 I worked with Sanna Sjøholt and Toril Hokseggen to create an "interactive
                    scrollable story" inspired by the UN's 17 sustainable goals. One of my group members had already
                    come up
                    with the idea of teeling a story about frogs, how they are important and how they are threatened. We
                    all
                    decided to sketch up a few different storyboards and we picked what we thought were the best scenes.
                    We
                    had
                    great ambition and a lot of fun in the beginning. We were hight inspired by <a target="_blank"
                        href="http://everylastdrop.co.uk/">Every Last Drop</a>. We imaged to follow a frog from one
                    scene to
                    the
                    next (like the man in the Every Last Drop website). We had a clear vision of an introduction of all
                    the
                    good
                    things frog "do" in the environment, then having a middle section informing on what challenges frogs
                    are
                    experiencing and a last section dedicated to what you can do to make things better. We realised
                    after a
                    while that following a frog from beginning to end would be too difficult for us technically. I
                    therefore
                    came up with the idea of the a frog bouncing into the scene every time (taking advantage of the
                    frogs'
                    bouncy nature).</p>
                <p>My part was the middle
                    part about frogs' challenges (from "but they are facing many challenges..." until "Experts are now
                    worried
                    about an AMPHIBIAN APOCALYPSE").</p>
                <p>I think our project strength is the storytelling aspect (which we were also told during the
                    presentation),
                    but our biggest challenge throughout was the technical aspect. Especially when it comes to JavaScrip
                    and
                    the
                    Intersection Observer. In the old version we managed to set it up (in the end), but the user
                    experience
                    isn't ideal as I would have prefered each scene to be "fixed" making the user unable to scroll
                    further
                    while
                    animationg. I would also have preferred the animations to run when scrolling generally (like in the
                    "Every
                    Last Drop" project). Another big issue has been getting the interactivity in the last section to
                    work
                    well.
                </p>
                <p>While I did not have sufficient time at this point to dig into JavaScript and make the scrolling
                    effects even better, I did manage to solve the more important issues like positioning of buttons and
                    better look and feel of the site. At this point the website isn't responsive and works best on wide
                    screens. I do, however, enjoy working on scrolling and animations and hope to improve the project
                    even further in the future.</p>
                <p>
                    Fixes:
                </p>
                <p>1. Positioning of headings, animated elements and buttons (where needed)</p>
                <p>2. More appropriate timing for animations, and in some cases adjusted animations</p>
                <p>3. Added additional info buttons (on the amphibian disease chytrid fungi scene and on the last
                    information scene)</p>
                <p>4. Changed font of subheadings to get more variation</p>
                <p>5. Added possibility for reduced motion for people with motion sensitivity (disabled animations
                    altogether)</p>
                <p>6. Improved the general look of the website</p>
